WorldEdit
=========

WorldEdit is a voxel and block manipulation library for Minecraft. It is
primarily a library but bindings to Bukkit (included) and SPC (external)
are available.

Compiling
---------

You need to have Maven installed (http://maven.apache.org). Once installed,
simply run:

    mvn clean package install
    
Maven will automatically download dependencies for you. Note: For that to work,
be sure to add Maven to your "PATH".
